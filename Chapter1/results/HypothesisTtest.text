Assumptions: H0: H null= there will be change in GFR in patients using statins after surgery as nephropathy contrast induced occurs thus GFR changed. H1: H Alternative: there will be no change in GFR in patients using statins, after surgery as statins are proven to be renal protective agents.
Interpretation of P value of 0.48 which is not statistically significant because it's > 0.05 in which my hypothesis of No change in GFR for patients on statins is rejected and the null hypothesis is not rejected,as Statins have protective renal effect which is proven by many studies, therefore GFR is expected to not be changed (reduced) after endovascular aortic surgery (in which Acute Kidney Injury as nephropathy can occur secondary to contrast that is given before the surgery as a result GFR may decrease after surgery).In our study null hypothesis can't be rejected as P value is > 0.05 which is 0.48 as GFR changed after procedure despite patients were on statins which have renal protective effects against nephropathy seconfary to contrast after endovascular aortic procedure in which patients were given Acetylcystine to reduce the severity of contrast induced nephropathy in which out of 192 patients who were statin useres, 31.97% of those statins users, were given Acetylecystine to reduce severity of contrast associated nephropathy and only 7.38% of statin users who didn't need to be given Acetylcystine as they didn't develop contrast induced nephropathy which was measured by change in GFR before and after enovascular aortic surgery.
