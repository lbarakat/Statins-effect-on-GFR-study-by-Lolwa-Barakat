Results:
One hundred and ninety-two (39.34%) of that total of 488 patients studied as shown in Figure A, were taking statins therapy before operation. There were several baseline characteristics were identified preoperatively of those patients who were on statins or not as illustrated in Table 1 and 2 of patient’s demographics who were included in this study. Age distribution among patient underwent endovascular aortic surgery was assessed as presented in Figure B with a mean age of 72 years and minimum age of 22 years and maximum of age of 93 years old in which it can be concluded according to the distribution of patients ages who were included in this study that young age, middle age and old age were all  involved which can reflect that this study have estimated ages between 22 years and 93 years old, that can generate results more practically than choosing only young or elderly patients in which discrimination in results can’t be excluded. It was reported in this study among statin users that male patients’ population percentage was higher than female patients as 30.12% and 9.22% respectively as shown in Figure C which reflect the truth of male population are prone to cardiovascular diseases more than female in which endovascular aortic surgery is needed in those high-risk population compared to female statins group. Diabetes status was investigated as presented in Figure D among all patients included to be 86.07% were non-diabetic, whereas only 13.93% were diabetic patients in which they have higher risk to develop acute kidney injury secondary to contrast of this surgery. As visualized in Figure E among all those diabetic patients, 9.07% were on statins, on the other hand, 4.92% were diabetic but not on statins therapy which correlate with the international guidelines of using statin in diabetic patients for primary prevention of coronary artery diseases as proved here that that majority of diabetic patients were on statins and only few were not on. For those statin users with a history of Congestive Heart Failure included in this study counts for only 2.05% as illustrated in Figure F, while the majority of statins users with a percentage of 37.3% of total population of this study, had no history of congestive heart failure which means that most of statin users without history of CHF that generate more accurate results in terms of GFR change dependent factors in which patient with congestive heart failure are prone to develop ACI secondary to contrast because of their chronic kidney disease associated with their hearty failure. In Figure G, it was obviously presented that the majority of statins users 31.97% were given Acetylcysteine for contrast-induced nephropathy in which it can be concluded that despite using statis, the majority of those patients developed nephropathy secondary to contrast in this surgery in which statins didn’t prove their renal protective effects against contrast in those populations and only 7.38% of statin users didn’t require Acetylcysteine as an antidot for contrast-induced acute kidney injury. Number of patients who needed emergency surgery due to AKI development associated with contrast use during or after surgery was of minimal percentage of 1.02% of statin users who required Emergency surgery as seen in Figure H which means that ACI was mostly reversable with the use of Acetylcysteine and almost all patients on statins 38.32% didn’t require Emergency Surgery except 1.02 % who did require for emergency surgery. Number of deaths in this retrospective study counted for 3.08 % of statins users who were expired during the surgery, while the 36.34% didn’t die as illustrated in Figure I. Finally, P value of 0.48 which is more than P value 0.05, was calculated via paired t test of GFR readings before and after surgery as seen in Figure J to conclude that it is not statistically significant in this study because there were changes in GFR readings before and after surgery which concludes that Statins therapy were not renal protective agents in those patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair as nephropathies were developed secondary to contrast, thereby GFR readings decreased after surgery and null hypothesis is not rejected.be renal protective agents.

Assumptions: H0: H null= there will be change in GFR in patients using statins after surgery as nephropathy contrast induced occurs thus GFR changed. H1: H Alternative: there will be no change in GFR in patients using statins, after surgery as statins are proven to be renal protective agents.

Interpretation of P value of 0.48 which is not statistically significant because it's > 0.05 in which my hypothesis of No change in GFR for patients on statins is rejected and the null hypothesis is not rejected,as Statins have protective renal effect which is proven by many studies, therefore GFR is expected to not be changed (reduced) after endovascular aortic surgery (in which Acute Kidney Injury as nephropathy can occur secondary to contrast that is given before the surgery as a result GFR may decrease after surgery).In our study null hypothesis can't be rejected as P value is > 0.05 which is 0.48 as GFR changed after procedure despite patients were on statins which have renal protective effects against nephropathy seconfary to contrast after endovascular aortic procedure in which patients were given Acetylcystine to reduce the severity of contrast induced nephropathy in which out of 192 patients who were statin useres, 31.97% of those statins users, were given Acetylecystine to reduce severity of contrast associated nephropathy and only 7.38% of statin users who didn't need to be given Acetylcystine as they didn't develop contrast induced nephropathy which was measured by change in GFR before and after enovascular aortic surgery.

Discussion and Conclusion:
Preoperative statins therapy failed to maintain the GFR in patients undergoing endovascular aortic repair. The results of our study are with agreement of recent meta-analysis study that showed that statins therapy did not decrease the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography7.in contrary, our results contrast those reported by Khanal et al who proved a significant lower incident of contrast nephropathy in Statins patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions 8. However, that study didn’t report the perioperative hydration status as this is an important factor to be considered before exposure to contrast media that affect GFR levels as negative fluid balance put patients under risk of developing contrast nephropathy. GFR is used as indicator of nephropathy associated with contrast as it is more sensitive indicator than serum creatinine alone to changes in renal function since GFR may be decreased by more than 75% before serum creatinine becomes anormal and elevated. Welten et al reported that statins didn’t reduce the incidence of AKI after open vascular surgery, although the statin use in that study was associated in early recovery of kidney injury9. In our study in patients undergoing endovascular aortic repair, statins did not show a protective renal effect on their renal function that was proved by reductions in their GFR levels after surgery in which statins didn’t improve short term renal outcomes and did not improve the worsening of renal function that was proved by the increase use of Acetylcysteine in 31.97 of statins users as antidote of GFR worsening secondary to contrast which conclude that statins did not exert protective renal effect and did not reverse the developing of contrast induced nephropathy. In addition our results suggest that factors such as age, gender, diabetic status, history of congestive heart failure may considered as more important determinants of post operative GFR than the use of statin therapy and baseline GFR which let us comes to the conclusion that preoperative renal reserve may be more important factor in predicting renal outcomes than a single renal protective intervention which is the statins therapy which couldn’t be the protective interventional factors as it was assumed and hypothesized. The number of emergency cases was small which account to 1.02% of statins users which indicates that contrast nephropathy which occurred in these population was reversable by Acetylcysteine antidot and hydration. Estimation of patients expired was minimal in statins users compared to non-statins users with 3.08% and 6.78% respectively. Our hypothesis of No change in GFR for patients on statins is rejected and the null hypothesis is not rejected, as Statins have protective renal effect which is proven by many studies that are mentioned earlier, therefore GFR is expected to not be reduced after endovascular aortic surgery (in which Acute Kidney Injury as nephropathy can occur secondary to contrast that is given before the surgery as a result GFR may decrease after surgery).In our study null hypothesis can't be rejected as P value is > 0.05 which is 0.48 as GFR changed after procedure despite patients were on statins which have renal protective effects against nephropathy secondary to contrast after endovascular aortic procedure in which patients were given Acetylcysteine to reduce the severity of contrast induced nephropathy in which out of 192 patients who were statin users, 31.97% of those statins users, were given Acetylcysteine to reduce severity of contrast associated nephropathy and only 7.38% of statin users who didn't need to be given Acetylcysteine as they didn't develop contrast induced nephropathy which was measured by change in GFR before and after endovascular aortic surgery.

Limitations:
This is an observational retrospective cohort study in which its results are subjected to potential bias in selection of participants, confounding and measurement bias. Therefore, a randomized controlled trials are needed to reduce these kinds of biases and compare statins users for the renal protective effect of statins before and after surgery prospectively.

In summary:
Our results did not support the theory that GFR will not be changed in patients who take preoperative statins than after surgery. In patients underwent endovascular aortic surgery, statins therapy is not associated with a statistically significant renal protective effect postoperatively P value is 0.48 in terms of no change in GFR levels compared to preoperative levels that was correlated with the need of Acetylcysteine use in 31.97% of statins users as an antidot for contrast-induced acute kidney injury during surgery and among these patients on statins 1.02% needed emergency surgery and 3.08% died during procedure.
