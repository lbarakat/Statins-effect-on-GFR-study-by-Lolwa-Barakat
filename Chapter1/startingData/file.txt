Title: Is there a renal protective effect of statins on their users in terms of no change in Glomerular filtration rate after endovascular aortic surgery 
Background: Nephropathy contrast induced is very common during endovascular aortic repair surgery that can be presented with lower GFR levels as a result of acute kidney injury which is secondary to contrast that is given during this procedure. It was proven that statins have renal protective effect which is described as pleiotropic effects in which statins are prescribed as primary prevention agents in patients with high risk of vascular diseases like diabetes and coronary artery diseases. For that reason, this study was conducted to examine the hypothesis of pleiotropic effects of statins in protecting kidneys in patients underwent aortic endovascular repair in terms of there would be no decline of their GFR readings after the surgery compared to GFR readings before it.
Methods: A cohort observational retrospective study of 488 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair between September 2012 and November 2014 in a tertiary hospital in USA. A paired t test statistical analysis method was used to assess the P value of their GFR readings changes before and after the surgery to examine the hypothesis of renal protective effect of statins in terms of there will be no change in the levels of estimated creatinine clearance.
Results: Statins use was associated with changes in GFR levels postoperatively (P=0.48) which is statistically insignificant. Acetylcysteine was given to 31.97% of statins users to decrease the severity of contrast -induced nephropathy, which was developed during surgery, compared to 7.38% who didnâ€™t require Acetylcysteine as there was no development of contrast associated nephropathy. Among Statin users 1.02% needed emergency surgery and 3.08% died during procedure.
Conclusion: In patients underwent endovascular aortic surgery, statins therapy is not associated with a statistically significant renal protective effect postoperatively in terms of no change in GFR levels compared to preoperative levels that was correlated with the need of Acetylcysteine use in 31.97% of statins users as an antidot for contrast-induced acute kidney injury during surgery and among these patients on statins 1.02% needed emergency surgery and 3.08% died during procedure.
