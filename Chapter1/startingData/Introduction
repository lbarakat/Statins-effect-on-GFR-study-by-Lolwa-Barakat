Introduction:
Nephropathy occurs in 1-5% of the patients undergo non-cardiac surgery and associated with high morbidity and hospitalization rate due to acute kidney injury. Statins are lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels and non-cholesterol mediated mechanisms thus protect kidney in patients with cardiovascular diseases as there is high risk of developing renal impairment and cardiovascular disease progression along with dyslipidemia. Statins therapy was proven by meta-analysis to slow the reduction  in the glomerular filtration rate .in addition statins decrease proteinuria in patients with cardiovascular disease high risk population such as diabetic patients and decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well1.Any GFR less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is considered to be pathological renal injury in which nephropathy is identified and staged accordingly2. Experimental  models revealed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins reduce the severity of glomerular injury thus preserve renal function 3. Statins were proven to have pleiotropic effects on renal function that clinically have positive implications on cardiovascular system in which statins not only reduce lipid levels in blood, but also have anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of signaling molecules at many points in the inflammation pathways in which atherosclerosis resulted which is defined as a process of inflammation associated with high levels of plasma inflammatory markers and immune cells accumulation in a form of atherosclerotic plaques. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory effect of statins improves endothelial function thus these lipid lowering agents play an important role in cardiovascular risk reduction in terms of morbidity and mortality reduction in which many studies showed evidence that statins have similar anti-inflammatory effects in the pathological renal vascular system in which it exerts its renal protective benefits. Since in renal impairment disease which can be caused by inflammatory etiological source, resulting in inflammation and functional changes in the renovascular endothelium which I responsible of progression of renal injury. As a result, Statins are considered to be effective in modulating renal function by alteration of the renal inflammatory response of kidneys thus reverse acute kidney injury as well as slow the progression of chronic kidney disease therefore they are effective in the treatment of renal disese4. Acute kidney injury occurs in endovascular aortic repair as a result of contrast-induced nephropathy, embolus in renal vessels or vascular stents encroachment on renal vessels. Contrast- induced nephropathy is identified by a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated creatinine clearance) of > or = 25% within 96 hours of exposure to contrast agent with exclusion of other causes which is resulted due to combination of medullary ischemia and direct tubular toxicity5. Statins decrease nitric oxide production, thereby increasing flow-mediated vasodilation and endothelial function. besides they reduce vascular events and death in patients with dyslipidemia and in coronary artery diseases patients. Moreover statins with their anti-inflammatory effects, scavenge free radicals in addition to their antithrombotic properties, because of all of these protective effects they are more likely to be protective to kidneys6.This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that in patients who use statins therapy, undergoing endovascular aortic repair, there will be no change in their GFR levels after this surgery compared to their GFR level before surgery, assuming that Statins are renal protective agents in those patients and will protect them from developing contrast-induced nephropathy that can be identified through change in GFR after surgery in terms of reduction in their GFR readings compared to GFR levels preoperatively.
